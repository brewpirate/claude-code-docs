# Claude Code Hook Events

> **New here?** Start with [GettingStarted/first-hook.md](../GettingStarted/first-hook.md) to create a working hook in under 10 minutes. Once your first hook is working, sections 1-3 below cover everything you need. Skip sections 4 (Matcher semantics), 5 (Scope & configuration), 6 (Security model), and 7 (Additional subsystems) until you need them.

Reference for Claude Code's event hook system — lifecycle events, handler types (command / http / prompt / agent), matcher syntax, and security model. Configure in `settings.json` or in skill/agent frontmatter.

## Overview

**8 sections**, **~34 entries** — 26 events across 8 categories + 4 handler types.

| # | Section | Description | Entries |
|---|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | [How event hooks work](./how-event-hooks-work.md) | Lifecycle events, handler types, matchers, scope precedence, SSRF protection, and Stop→SubagentStop auto-conversion. | narrative |
| 2 | [Event reference](./event-reference.md) | All 26 hook events grouped by category — Session Lifecycle, User Input, Tool Use, Sub-Agents, Tasks, Environment Changes, Compaction, Elicitation. | 26 events / 8 categories |
| 3 | [Handler types](./handler-types.md) | The four handler types — `command`, `http`, `prompt`, `agent` — with config fields, behavior, security, and YAML examples. | 4 entries |
| 4 | [Matcher semantics](./matcher-semantics.md) | How `matcher` fields filter events per category — regex for tools, glob for files, exact name for agents/config. | narrative |
| 5 | [Scope & configuration](./scope-configuration.md) | Cross-links to settings.json `hooks` key, skill/agent frontmatter `hooks:` field, plugin hooks, and managed-only keys. | narrative |
| 6 | [Security model](./security-model.md) | SSRF guard (blocks RFC1918, link-local, cloud metadata), env-var allowlist, shell-execution gate, managed lockdown, timeouts. | narrative |
| 7 | [Additional hook subsystems (internal)](./additional-hook-subsystems.md) | Hedged references to internal hook machinery files NOT inspected — registry, config manager, file-watcher, post-sampling hooks. | narrative |
| 8 | [Discrepancies & notes](./discrepancies-notes.md) | Undocumented handler fields (`statusMessage`, `once`, `if`, `shell`, `asyncRewake`), matcher variations, decision precedence, SSRF edge cases. | narrative |
